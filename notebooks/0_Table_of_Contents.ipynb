    "## DISCLAIMER ABOUT JUPYTERLITE\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is running in your web browser (e.g. under xdsl-workshop.datenvorr.at), then you are using JupyterLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of disclaimers about this tech, as it is still very much in experimental and prone to breakage:\n",
    "\n",
    " - You can edit these files, and your browser will save them in local storage.\n",
    " - Therefore you will not receive new files if we push new versions of the notebooks.\n",
    " - The only way to get the latest version of the notebooks is by **clearing your browser cache for this website. THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE NOTEBOOKS YOU SAVED ON THIS WEBSITE.**\n",
    " - Jupyter Lite is broken in some webbrowsers:\n",
    "    - Safari\n",
    "    - Most private browser windows\n",
    " - You can download notebooks from this service, to keep your files. Browser storage is not guaranteed to be stable!\n",
    " - If something breaks, please try to:\n",
    "   1. Restart the Python kernels\n",
    "   2. Clear your cache and reload. ⚠️ This will clear your local changes too.\n",
    "   3. Report as a bug\n",
    " - You can `pip install` in Jupyter Lite, but only pure Python packages. You can do so with `%pip install <package>`, but need to do so on every kernel restart. Some packages are already available, try to `import` first.\n"
